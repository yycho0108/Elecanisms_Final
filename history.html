                            At the end of Sprint 1, we had a <strong>small-scale board</strong> designed and built. The
                            aims of Sprint 1 were to, connect with the <strong>RasPi</strong> to communicate with the
                            <strong>Wii balance board</strong>, and to design and test our <strong>initial mechatronic
                            system</strong> for the tilt mechanism.<br/>

                            Mechanically, the biggest insight of this sprint was with the ball joints used in mounting
                            the tilting board to the base. We were using ball joints for all 3 connections, and this
                            left an extra degree of freedom allowing the tilting board to spin rather than purely tilt.
                            This made us realize we needed to use a U-joint in the center mount to prevent the rotation.<br/>

                            Electrically, the challenge was to give the servos 5V, when the signal from the PIC was only
                            3.3V. We developed the logic converters shown in the <a href="electrical.html">Electrical
                            Design section</a> during this sprint.<br>

                        <p>
                            Sprint 2 was a lot of experimentation and growth. By the end of this sprint, we had <strong>defined
                            our MVP</strong>, built a <strong>full-scale model</strong> of the game, and had tested
                            several <strong>actuation and data collection</strong> methods.
                            <br/>
                            During the sprint, we Shopbotted our first life-sized hull; due to
                            lack of foresight and changing designs, the panels had to be postprocessed nonetheless to
                            accomodate our central maze and the spinner.
                            <br/>
                            We also implemented our initial layout of the FSM, with which we could control flippers and
                            the central spinner. We also had the coin mechanism working, and mostly accomplished lots of
                            tasks in the way. A lot of work was spent on debugging; the linear actuator was
                            malfunctioning, for instance, as well as the accelerometer library. After a period of
                            efforts in vain, we prioritized on the integrated product, so both of these efforts were
                            tabled.
                            <br/>
                            Overall, we determined our MVP and were well on our way to making a complete game.

                        <p>This sprint marked our Minimum Viable Game.<br/>
                            <strong>Mechanically</strong>, we successfully made the game
                            robust with a U-joint designed for a car steering rack. This prevented twisting and made it
                            substantially less likely that an errant 4th grader would damage the system. We additionally
                            solved our issues with the center spinner clearance that we were having in Sprint 2 by
                            increasing the gap between the walls to allow the ball to easily travel between them,
                            lengthening the connection to prevent interference between the walls and the game surface,
                            and integrating the blocking outcrop into our 3D printed part, rather than having a wood
                            flap that fell off during testing.<br/>
                            <strong>Electrically</strong>, we wired improved the strength of the electromagnets by using
                            a boost
                            converter to step up the 12V power supply potential to 30V. However, we were actuating this
                            signal directly with a simple push-button. Moving forward, we would need to use mosfets to
                            electronically control the actuation of the electromagnets This allowed us to design the
                            electrical system, even without being integrated in the code yet. We tested the pop bumper,
                            so that we could integrate it in the next sprint, and wired up buttons for control as well,
                            and started planning for moving our circuit to proto-boards.<br/>
                            For <strong>Software</strong>, we updated the state machine to be easily extensible (this
                            turned out to be
                            extremely helpful later on), and had all the game logic and active element control
                            implemented and tested. This was also the sprint where we got the LCD screen with
                            instructions working.</p>

                        <p>The final 2 weeks of our project were mostly dedicated to <strong>polish</strong> and
                            <strong>robustness</strong>. We improved
                            electrical connections, worked out software bugs, recut panels, painted the the game, and
                            more. We took all the design insight we had learned prior and cut an entire set on new body
                            panels out of MDF. We chose MDF over plywood this time around as it was less subject to warp
                            (our 1st game area was a little askew).<br/>
                            The hardboard maze was designed to slot directly into the game surface as a press fit rather
                            than needing to be fastened down by screws, as was the case with the first design. Lastly, a
                            coat of black paint was applied to all the exposed surfaces and a layer of while vinyl was
                            used to cover the countersunk screws holding in various components into the game area.<br/>
                            When we revisited the Raspberry Pi, it unexpectedly broke down, so we had to reconfigure
                            another one. A lot of effort was put into making the startup sequence, as well as the
                            following execution sequence, robust and reliable, so that the game would be a <strong>plug-and-play
                                experience</strong>.
