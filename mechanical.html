                <p>Our game has the general dimensions of 36” x 24” x 12”. The primary construction was ½” MDF and ⅛”
                    hardboard. The tilting functionality of the game is acheived through 2 servos acting as linear
                    actuators to control the X and Y axes. The center of the board is affixed to a larger U-Joint to
                    constrain any rotation about the center. The servos connect to a linkage mounted 7-½” from the
                    origin through a linkage and attach to the tilting surface via a ball joint. </p>

                            allow easy fastening of components. Clearance between the coin mechanism and tilting plane
                            is very small as we wanted to keep the Z height as compact as possible. A pass-through hole
                            was added to allow inserted pennies to pass through back to the exterior of the machine
                            easily: it would not be a very profitable operation as-is. <i class="fa fa-smile-o"></i></p>

                        <p>
                            Our original design featured exclusively ball joints but was found to be underconstrained.
                            While we could achieve the desired tilting action, rotations of the surface was possible in
                            any position. After attempting to implement custom made U-joints made in the a Autodesk
                            Ember, a more robust solution was needed. We purchased a U-joint meant for automotive use to
                            ensure that it would not be a weak link in our operation. <br/>

                            With the origin of the board being the center point, the longer side was defined as the x
                            axis while the shorter side was parallel to the y axis. We placed the servo mechanism At
                            equal distances from the center on each axis. To get sufficient force out of our linear
                            actuators, we first spec'd very large HS-805BB servos and gave them a moment arm of just 1
                            ½”. This was enough mechanical advantage to both achieve the desired tilt angle and leave
                            the servos plenty of mechanical overhead while tilting the platform to an acceptable
                            angle.</p>

                        </header>
                        <p>The <strong>Main game area</strong> was made up of a series of both <em>static</em> and <em>dynamic</em>
                            components. The
                            <strong>perimeter walls</strong> stand 2” high and surround three layers of concentric
                            hexagons. The majority of our static obstacles are part of this structure. <em>Gaps</em> and
                            <em>extra walls</em> are strategically placed throughout the design to allow the Player to
                            traverse through the game but also
                            challenge them to take <em>specific routes</em> that expose the ball to the active elements.<br/>
                            The center of the hexagonal structure is guarded by a <strong>rotating wall</strong> driven
                            by a servo. The wall has two layers: the <em>inner layer</em>, a full circle guards the
                            servo itself from the ball, and the <em>outer layers</em>, which are two arcs along a bigger
                            circle with two openings. By rotating the middle circular wall (over a maximum range of
                            180o), Player 2 can trap the ball within the walls in an attempt to prevent Player 1 from
                            proceeding.

                        </header>
                        <p>The game starts with Player 2 taking the ball and placing it in the <strong>start
                            area</strong>, through a
                            hole in the lid. For safety’s sake, we added a lid to the tilting box, to prevent the ball
                            from being thrown from the game area. The lid is made of clear polycarbonate, due to its
                            ability to be jump sheared and drilled into more easily than acrylic can. It is mounted on
                            the game area with two door hinges from McMaster Carr, which allow for <em>smooth opening
                                and
                                closing</em> without a need for a latch. The lid also has a collapsible handle, so it
                            stays out
                            of the way during gameplay, but the lid can be easily opened. The hole in the corner leading
                            to the start area is cut by a 1 inch hole saw. The start area is a simple servo with a
                            3D-printed wall attached. When both Player s are ready, the servo rotates just under 90
                            degrees to open the wall so Player 1 can guide the ball into the <strong>Main Area.</strong>

                        <p> The final area of the game has several main components. The first greeting the Player 1 on
                            the way to the goal is a final <strong>electromagnet</strong>. If that fails, next trick in
                            Player 2’s
                            arsenal are the pinball-esque <strong>flippers</strong>. In our implementation, they work
                            slightly
                            differently than in pinball. Yes, they can be used to swat away the approaching ball, but
                            they are strategically placed so that Player 2 can box out Player 1 into a single side of
                            the and area and keep them from getting to the goal. If Player 1 does manage to avoid these
                            perils, the end goal is a 3D printed wall attachment designed to funnel the Player in the
                            end goal contact. Given the structure was to be 3D printed, some liberties were taken in
                            respect to its freeform design.</p>

                        <p>While Player 1’s sole form of input is the <strong>Wii balance board</strong> with the
                            instruction of an <strong>LCD</strong> integrated into the sidewall of the game. Player 2
                            gets their own control panel (also with an LCD). The panel has <strong>4 discrete
                                buttons</strong> and a slide <strong>potentiometer</strong> for them to interact with. 2
                            buttons on the left side are dedicated to the actuation of their respective
                            <strong>flippers</strong>. The middle potentiometer dictates rotation of the <strong>central
                                spinner</strong>. The lower right button, activates the game area’s <strong>3
                                electromagnets</strong>. Due to pin-count constraints, the single button actuates all
                            the electromagnets simultaneously. Finally, the <strong>start button</strong> is located
                            in the top right of the panel and doubles to reverse the tilting direction of Player 1
                            during gameplay. Both the electromagnets and reversing function have a “cool down” period as
                            to make gameplay more competitive.</p>
