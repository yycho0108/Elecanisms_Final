                        <p>
                            At the end of Sprint 1, we had a small-scale board designed and built. The aims of Sprint 1
                            were to design and test our tilt mechanism, connect with the RasPi to communicate with the
                            Wii balance board, and to make our initial electrical system to control the servos.<br/>

                            Mechanically, the biggest insight of this sprint was with the ball joints used in mounting
                            the tilting board to the base. We were using ball joints for all 3 connections, and this
                            left an extra degree of freedom allowing the tilting board to spin rather than purely tilt.
                            This made us realize we needed to use a U-joint in the center mount to prevent the rotation.

                            Electrically, the challenge was to give the servos 5V, when the signal from the PIC was only
                            3.3V. We developed the logic converters shown in the <a href="electrical.html">Electrical
                            Design section</a> during this sprint.<br>

                        </header>
                        <p>
                            Sprint 2 marked the first attempt to build a full scale iteration of our game. We had
                            settled on dimensions and purchased a 4x8 sheet of plywood to shopbot all the panels.
                            Admittedly, we had limited foresight to the exact gameplay in the game area at the time of
                            shopbotting. Because of this a lot of holes for elements has to be manually drilled in after
                            the fact.

                            The end result wasn't very pretty, but our game layout was starting to take shape! It was at
                            this time that we started to come up with the central maze and spinner concept. It didn't
                            work perfectly, but we had a playable game and fast approaching our MVP. We had the coin
                            mechanism, flippers, central spinner, and electromagnets working to varying degrees using a
                            breadboard to connect everything. This was the last sprint where we were still attempting to
                            use Hunter’s SLA printed u-joint design. It was through it’s use in a full scale build that
                            we determined that they were not robust enough. In software and electrical, the coin
                            mechanism was successfully communicating with the board, and had preliminary state machine
                            structure set up for the game.
                            This was, unfortunately, a sprint where we did a lot of work that didn’t end up in the final
                            game. We spent a significant amount of this sprint working on getting linear actuators and
                            accelerometers working. We were struggling to effectively control the linear actuators
                            available, finding that rather than moving smoothly, they would jitter about a seemingly
                            random position. After this sprint was over, we determined that it would be a better use of
                            our time to find different active elements that didn’t require linear actuators.
                            The accelerometer was intended to solve the problems that we were having with the board
                            being more difficult to tilt in one direction than the opposite. We spent the sprint
                            modifying an existing library to convert the data that the accelerometer was getting to
                            useful angles for us. We also spent time converting the library to interface with C
                            functions rather than python functions, but were still struggling at the end of the sprint.
                            Unfortunately, this work was put to the side and not picked up again, when we realized that
                            the accelerometer was unnecessary for our MVP, and would be detrimental to our work towards
                            getting to a working system.
                            Overall, the biggest thing we got out of Sprint 2 was a defined MVP. We spent time after our
                            sprint review identifying the necessary features and components to get a game that would
                            work and that we could be proud of, and adjusted what each of us were working on to get to
                            that MVP, while fulfilling each of our learning goals.

                        </header>
                        <p>This sprint marked our Minimum Viable Game. Mechanically, we successfully made the game
                            robust with a U-joint designed for a car steering rack. This prevented twisting and made it
                            substantially less likely that an errant 4th grader would damage the system. We additionally
                            solved our issues with the center spinner clearance that we were having in Sprint 2 by
                            increasing the gap between the walls to allow the ball to easily travel between them,
                            lengthening the connection to prevent interference between the walls and the game surface,
                            and integrating the blocking outcrop into our 3D printed part, rather than having a wood
                            flap that fell off during testing.
                            Electrically, we wired improved the strength of the electromagnets by using a boost
                            converter to step up the 12V power supply potential to 30V. However, we were actuating this
                            signal directly with a simple push-button. Moving forward, we would need to use mosfets to
                            electronically control the actuation of the electromagnets This allowed us to design the
                            electrical system, even without being integrated in the code yet. We tested the pop bumper,
                            so that we could integrate it in the next sprint, and wired up buttons for control as well,
                            and started planning for moving our circuit to proto-boards.
                            For software, we updated the state machine to be easily extensible (this turned out to be
                            extremely helpful later on), and had all the game logic and active element control
                            implemented and tested. This was also the sprint where we got the LCD screen with
                            instructions working.</p>

                        <p>The final 2 weeks of our project were mostly dedicated to polish and robustness. We improved
                            electrical connections, worked out software bugs, recut panels, painted the the game, and
                            more. We took all the design insight we had learned prior and cut an entire set on new body
                            panels out of MDF. We chose MDF over plywood this time around as it was less subject to warp
                            (our 1st game area was a little askew). The hardboard maze was designed to slot directly
                            into the game surface as a press fit rather than needing to be fastened down by screws, as
                            was the case with the first design. Lastly, a coat of black paint was applied to all the
                            exposed surfaces and a layer of while vinyl was used to cover the countersunk screws holding
                            in various components into the game area.</p>
