                        <p>
                            At the end of Sprint 1, we had a small-scale board designed and built. The aims of Sprint 1
                            were to design and test our tilt mechanism, connect with the RasPi to communicate with the
                            Wii balance board, and to make our initial electrical system to control the servos.<br/>

                            Mechanically, the biggest insight of this sprint was with the ball joints used in mounting
                            the tilting board to the base. We were using ball joints for all 3 connections, and this
                            left an extra degree of freedom allowing the tilting board to spin rather than purely tilt.
                            This made us realize we needed to use a U-joint in the center mount to prevent the rotation.

                            Electrically, the challenge was to give the servos 5V, when the signal from the PIC was only
                            3.3V. We developed the logic converters shown in the <a href="electrical.html">Electrical
                            Design section</a> during this sprint.<br>

                        </header>
                        <p>
                            Sprint 2 was a lot of experimentation and growth.  By the end of this sprint, we had defined our MVP, built a full-scale model of the game, and had tested several actuation and data collection methods.
                            <br><br/>
                            Mechanically speaking, we built the first full iteration of the box. We used a ShopBot to make the necessary panels, but needed to make most of our mounting holes by hand to accommodate our changing design.We developed the concept of a central maze and spinner obstacle, and had the flippers and electromagnets mounted.
                            <br><br/>
                            Electrically, not much progress was made.  We werenâ€™t doing anything particularly new that required electrical redesign.
                            <br><br/>
                            Software wise, we could control flippers and the central spinner, had a preliminary state machine set up, and had gotten the coin mechanism working.  There was a lot of work done on trying to control a linear actuator - the idea was to use this to control an active element, but after a week of struggling, this work was put on hold.  We also wanted to use an accelerometer to calibrate the tilt response of the board.  We modified the mpu library available, but determined at the end of the sprint that we needed to focus our time on the MVP rather than cool sensors that would only marginally improve the gameplay, and the accelerometer was tabled.
                            <br><br/>
                            Overall, we determined our MVP and were well on our way to making a complete game.

                        </header>
                        <p>This sprint marked our Minimum Viable Game. Mechanically, we successfully made the game
                            robust with a U-joint designed for a car steering rack. This prevented twisting and made it
                            substantially less likely that an errant 4th grader would damage the system. We additionally
                            solved our issues with the center spinner clearance that we were having in Sprint 2 by
                            increasing the gap between the walls to allow the ball to easily travel between them,
                            lengthening the connection to prevent interference between the walls and the game surface,
                            and integrating the blocking outcrop into our 3D printed part, rather than having a wood
                            flap that fell off during testing.
                            Electrically, we wired improved the strength of the electromagnets by using a boost
                            converter to step up the 12V power supply potential to 30V. However, we were actuating this
                            signal directly with a simple push-button. Moving forward, we would need to use mosfets to
                            electronically control the actuation of the electromagnets This allowed us to design the
                            electrical system, even without being integrated in the code yet. We tested the pop bumper,
                            so that we could integrate it in the next sprint, and wired up buttons for control as well,
                            and started planning for moving our circuit to proto-boards.
                            For software, we updated the state machine to be easily extensible (this turned out to be
                            extremely helpful later on), and had all the game logic and active element control
                            implemented and tested. This was also the sprint where we got the LCD screen with
                            instructions working.</p>

                        <p>The final 2 weeks of our project were mostly dedicated to polish and robustness. We improved
                            electrical connections, worked out software bugs, recut panels, painted the the game, and
                            more. We took all the design insight we had learned prior and cut an entire set on new body
                            panels out of MDF. We chose MDF over plywood this time around as it was less subject to warp
                            (our 1st game area was a little askew). The hardboard maze was designed to slot directly
                            into the game surface as a press fit rather than needing to be fastened down by screws, as
                            was the case with the first design. Lastly, a coat of black paint was applied to all the
                            exposed surfaces and a layer of while vinyl was used to cover the countersunk screws holding
                            in various components into the game area.</p>
